REALLY IMPORTANT TODOS:

    1. Cover parser and lexer with more tests IMPORTANT new syntax is untested!!!
    2. Extend language with:
        a) objects -- for now I'm not sure how to do them
        b) member access operator . (dot)
    3. Code analyzer -- will analyze for undeclared variables,
      illegal statements, maybe typechecking?
    4. Stable and reliable interpreter

NOT REALLY IMPORTANT TODOS:

    Stack-based virtual machine with manageable heap
    and types support
    Compiler to bytecode
    => better way to execute the code

WHAT I'M IMPLEMENTING RIGHT NOW:

    Starting interpreter
    I need to implement a good type system and lexical scope

    Lexical scope, fucntions, interpreter::executeStatement,
    operations on types
