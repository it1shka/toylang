REALLY IMPORTANT TODOS:

1. Cover parser with more tests and lexer
2. Extend language with:
    a) strings -- "Hello world!", 'Tikhon'
    b) arrays -- [1, 2, 3, 'Hello', lambda(a) { return a * 2; }]
    c) objects -- for now I'm not sure how to do them
    d) two new 'get' operators: dot syntax '.' and bracket syntax '[]'
    e) null -- for now there is no way how to denote None/null/Nothing/nil
3. Code analyzer -- will analyze for undeclared variables,
  illegal statements, maybe typechecking?
4. Split project into multiple libraries using
  add_library() in CMake, and link those libraries together.
  Generally it would be good to care a little bit more about my
  CMakeLists.txt files

NOT REALLY IMPORTANT FOR NOW:
Think how to implement interpreter
Bare interpreter with visiting all the nodes?
Developing my own bytecode?
Emitting my own bytecode in runtime and then executing it?
We will see

Type system?

Import system!!!!!

And maybe before changing from monolith binary
to multiple libraries it would be good to
read how to revert changes with Git, so
if anything goes wrong I can fix it just by
reverting to previous version
