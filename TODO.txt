1. Cover code with tests
3. Code analyzer
4. better import statements

Make an import system implemented
right in the interpreter.

Since functions are lazy evaluated and
they contain references to AST,
I need to keep all the imported ASTs inside of
an importing interpreter.

Also, I need to support showing
in which file the error was thrown, so
the user knows where is this function defined
(the function that threw an error)
